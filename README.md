# JET

This repo contains some HTML pages I created while I was on the
[JET Programme][] in [Kōchi Prefecture][] (2001-2004).

The code in this repo is terrible, since I had no idea what I was doing at the
time. However, I've left it pretty much as it was written, except for any
changes that needed to be performed to remove stale information, and allow the
pages to be deployed to [Github Pages][] and work as expected.

So, it simply stands as a historical record, and probably of interest to no one
else but me.

## Pages

### For Sale

<https://www.paulfioravanti.com/jet/ForSale/forsale.html>

As I was about to leave Kōchi City for good, I made this page to sell my stuff.
I think I had just learned how to mark up `<table>`s and use HTML tag
attributes, but clearly things like indentation weren't on my radar yet.

No idea where I hosted this page so that it could get seen by other JETs, but
I have a feeling it was on [No IP][] when they were a fledgling service and you
could use it for free.

I don't remember how much I ended up getting for any of this stuff, nor whether
I was able to sell everything, but some of those prices seem downright
delusional given how expensive it is to throw away hard rubbish in Japan. I kind
of wish I still had that iMac and GameCube, though...

### Menu

<https://www.paulfioravanti.com/jet/Menus/asahilunchmenu.html>

This page contains an English translation of the lunch menu for the
[Asahi Royal Hotel][] in Kōchi City (ホテル日航高知 旭ロイヤル), accurate as of
2nd March, 2004 (I don't seem to have the original Japanese version, so you'll
just have to trust that it's probably accurate enough). Unfortunately, Asahi
Royal are no longer operating as of 31 March 2023.

Back on JET, in my quest to figure out some kind of relevant
"internationalisation" work that I could do as a [CIR][], I came up with a
plan to offer free English menu translations to restaurants, and Asahi Royal
Hotel was one of the few to take me up on it. For Japanese readers, here are
some articles from [Kōchi Shinbun][] about it (not searchable on their site, so
it seems the article was paper only):
